# 1.1: SHORT LONG SHORT

# Write a method that takes two strings as arguments, determines the longest of the two strings, and then returns the result of concatenating the shorter string, the longer string, and the shorter string once again. You may assume that the strings are of different lengths.

# Examples:

# short_long_short('abc', 'defgh') == "abcdefghabc"
# short_long_short('abcde', 'fgh') == "fghabcdefgh"
# short_long_short('', 'xyz') == "xyz"

# 4.2: WHAT CENTURY IS THAT?

# Write a method that takes a year as input and returns the century. The return value should be a string that begins with the century number, and ends with st, nd, rd, or th as appropriate for that number.

# New centuries begin in years that end with 01. So, the years 1901-2000 comprise the 20th century.

# Examples:

# century(2000) == '20th'
# century(2001) == '21st'
# century(1965) == '20th'
# century(256) == '3rd'
# century(5) == '1st'
# century(10103) == '102nd'
# century(1052) == '11th'
# century(1127) == '12th'
# century(11201) == '113th'

# 4.3: LEAP YEARS (PART 1)

# In the modern era under the Gregorian Calendar, leap years occur in every year that is evenly divisible by 4, unless the year is also divisible by 100. If the year is evenly divisible by 100, then it is not a leap year unless the year is evenly divisible by 400.

# 4.7: CONVERT A STRING TO A NUMBER!

# Write a method that takes a String of digits, and returns the appropriate number as an integer. You may not use any of the methods mentioned above.

# For now, do not worry about leading + or - signs, nor should you worry about invalid characters; assume all characters will be numeric.

# You may not use any of the standard conversion methods available in Ruby, such as String#to_i, Integer(), etc. Your method should do this the old-fashioned way and calculate the result by analyzing the characters in the string.

# Write a method that takes a String of digits, and returns the appropriate number as an integer. The String may have a leading + or - sign; if the first character is a +, your method should return a positive number; if it is a -, your method should return a negative number. If no sign is given, you should return a positive number.

# You may assume the string will always contain a valid number.
