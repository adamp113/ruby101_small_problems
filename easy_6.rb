# EASY 6 SMALL PROBLEMS


# 6.1: CUTE ANGLES

# Write a method that takes a floating point number that represents an angle between 0 and 360 degrees and returns a String that represents that angle in degrees, minutes and seconds. You should use a degree symbol (°) to represent degrees, a single quote (') to represent minutes, and a double quote (") to represent seconds. A degree has 60 minutes, while a minute has 60 seconds.

# Examples:

# You may use this constant to represent the degree symbol:

DEGREE = "\xC2\xB0"
MINUTES_PER_DEGREE = 60
SECONDS_PER_MINUTE = 60
SECONDS_PER_DEGREE = MINUTES_PER_DEGREE * SECONDS_PER_MINUTE

def dms(degrees_float)
  total_seconds = (degrees_float * SECONDS_PER_DEGREE).round
  degrees, remaining_seconds = total_seconds.divmod(SECONDS_PER_DEGREE)
  minutes, seconds = remaining_seconds.divmod(SECONDS_PER_MINUTE)
  format(%(#{degrees}#{DEGREE}%02d'%02d"), minutes, seconds)
end


dms(30) == %(30°00'00")
dms(76.73) == %(76°43'48")
dms(254.6) == %(254°36'00")
dms(93.034773) == %(93°02'05")

# 6.2: DELETE VOWELS

# Write a method that takes an array of strings, and returns an array of the same string values, except with the vowels (a, e, i, o, u) removed.

  array.map { |string| string.delete('aeiouAEIOU') }

# 6.3: FIBONACCI NUMBER LOCATION BY LENGTH

# The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...) such that the first 2 numbers are 1 by definition, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers. This series appears throughout the natural world.

# Computationally, the Fibonacci series is a very simple series, but the results grow at an incredibly rapid rate. For example, the 100th Fibonacci number is 354,224,848,179,261,915,075 -- that's enormous, especially considering that it takes 6 iterations before it generates the first 2 digit number.

# Write a method that calculates and returns the index of the first Fibonacci number that has the number of digits specified as an argument. (The first Fibonacci number has index 1.)

def find_fibonacci_index_by_length(number_digits)
  first = 1
  second = 1

    index += 1
    fibonacci = first + second
    break if fibonacci.to_s.size >= number_digits

    first = second
    second = fibonacci
  end

# 6.4: REVERSED ARRAYS (PART 1)
